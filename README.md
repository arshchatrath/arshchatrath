# Hi there, I'm Arsh Chatrath 👋

🎓 I'm a Computer Science and Business Systems undergrad at **Thapar University**, passionate about tech, product building, and solving real-world problems.

🚀 Currently working on **Talkeys**, a platform to connect college communities, discover events, and enable meaningful interactions.

🎨 I love crafting intuitive and clean **UI/UX**, and I'm constantly learning how to bridge design with functionality.

💼 Beyond code, I'm actively involved in **event management**, **sponsorships**, and **community building** through societies like **ISTE** and **Enactus Thapar**.

🧠 Some things I'm exploring:
- Product thinking & startup ecosystems
- Frontend development & design systems
- Marketing & student-focused innovations
